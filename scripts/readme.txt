	1. Installation

*****************************************************************

To run the Dark Tower game you need the Java Runtime Environment J2SE 1.4.0 (JRE)
or the Java Software Development Kit J2SE 1.4.0 (SDK).
You can download it from 

    http://java.sun.com/downloads.html

After installing the Java Runtime Environment you can start the game by 
simple double clicking on the "darktower.jar" file.
If this does not work you can start the game manually with the following
command entered at the DOS-Prompt:

    javaw.exe -jar darktower.jar

First you must change to the directory where you have copied the
"darktower.jar" file. This can be done with the "CD <directory>" command.
Alternative you can use the "darktower.cmd" batchfile to start the game.
